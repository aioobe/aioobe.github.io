title: "What's with the …file suffix in file names?!"
date: 2018-09-17

We have `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `Caddyfile`, `Gemfile`, `Rakefile`, `Vagrantfile`, `Cakefile` and probably a lot more that `…file` files that I've yet to come across.

Dear config file inventor: _I know they are files!_ My terminal even shows directories in a different color!

What's wrong with traditional file extensions? How about `docker.conf`?

What's next? `logdirectory/`, `datadirectory/`, `srcdirectory/`?

Please, no more file names from the Department of Redundancy Department!
