Today I got the BeUno implant inserted! It's a cylindrical 2x15 mm chip inserted with a syringe. It allows you to read the body temperature using the BeUno app.

The app works really well. Signal from the chip is good. I can get a reading on my Samsung Galaxy S20 without removing my phone cover.

The cost was 249 € for the chip, and about 150 € for the procedure. I did it at [Platinum Ink Piercing](https://platinuminkpiercing.se/) and they were very professional.

Here's a video of the procedure followed by a reading of the body temperature.
