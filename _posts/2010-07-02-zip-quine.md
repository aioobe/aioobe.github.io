Has the thought ever struck you whether it is possible to have a zip-file that contains nothing but a copy itself? If there is a fix-point of the zip-function so to speak. Well, here you have one: <center>{% include blog_link.html url="r.zip" %}</center>

A funny observation: When trying to send this file to my friend, Gmail complains and says it might contain a virus. I guess the server got tired of digging deeper into the file :-)
