## Note to recruiters
Thanks for reaching out. I'm not actively looking for new opportunities at the moment, but if you think you have an extraordinary offer (60k+ SEK/month or some interesting startup for instance) I'm open to discussing it further.

### My current position
I currently have a position at Oracle in Stockholm, Sweden, which I am satisfied with. I'm working in the langtools team, and am currently developing the javac compiler.

### Relocation
I have a young family with kids in school, so a relocation would be inconvenient at this time.

### My interests and skillset
Regardless of what my tags on StackOverflow say, I'm not an Android or C++ developer. I like Java. I don't mind working with Scala, Clojure or other JVM languages either. My OS of choice is GNU/Linux. Should I ever be forced to switch it would be considered a drawback. I would some day like to work in a start up environment.

My r&eacute;sum&eacute; is avaliable <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>.
