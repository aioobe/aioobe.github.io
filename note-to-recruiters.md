## Note to recruiters
Thanks for reaching out. While I'm not actively looking for new opportunities at the moment, I'm always open for suggestions.

### My current position
I currently have a position at Oracle in Stockholm, Sweden, which I am satisfied with. If you have an extraordinary offer however (60k+ SEK/month or some interesting startup for instance), I'm open for suggestions.

### Relocation
I have a young family with kids in school, so a relocation would be inconvenient at this time.

### My interests and skillset
Regardless of what my tags on StackOverflow say, I'm not an Android developer or C++ developer. I like Java. I wouldn't mind working with Scala, Clojure or other JVM languages either. My OS of choice is GNU/Linux, and being forced to switch to some other environment would be considered a drawback. I would some day like to work in a start up environment.

My r&eacute;sum&eacute; is avaliable <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>.
