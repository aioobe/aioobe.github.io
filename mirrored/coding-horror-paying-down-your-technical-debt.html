<h3 class="date">February 27, 2009</h3> 

<p>
Every software project I've ever worked on has <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">accrued technical debt</a> over time: 
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
Technical Debt is a wonderful metaphor <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TechnicalDebt">developed by Ward Cunningham</a>
 to help us think about this problem. In this metaphor, doing things the
 quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar 
to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs 
interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we 
have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design 
choice. We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay 
down the principal by refactoring the quick and dirty design into the 
better design. Although it costs to pay down the principal, we gain by 
reduced interest payments in the future.
<p>
The metaphor also explains why it may be sensible to do the quick and 
dirty approach. Just as a business incurs some debt to take advantage of
 a market opportunity developers may incur technical debt to hit an 
important deadline. The all too common problem is that development 
organizations let their debt get out of control and spend most of their 
future development effort paying crippling interest payments.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
No matter how talented and smart the software developers, all these tiny
 deferments begin to add up and cumulatively weigh on the project, 
dragging it down. My latest project is no different. After six solid 
months working on the Stack Overflow codebase, this is <i>exactly</i> where we are. We're digging in our heels and retrenching for a major refactoring of our database.  We have to <b>stop working on new features for a while and pay down some of our technical debt</b>.
</p><p>
<img alt="credit cards" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777074ad970c" src="coding-horror-paying-down-your-technical-debt_files/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777074ad970c-pi.jpeg" height="404" width="600" border="0">
</p><p>
I believe that accruing technical debt is unavoidable on any real software project. Sure, you <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RefactorAsYouGo">refactor as you go</a>,
 and incorporate improvements when you can -- but it's impossible to 
predict exactly how those key decisions you made early on in the project
 are going to play out. All you can do is roll with the punches, and 
budget some time into the schedule to <b>periodically pay down your technical debt.</b>
</p><p>
The time you take out of the schedule to make technical debt payments 
typically doesn't result in anything the customers or users will see. 
This can sometimes be hard to justify. In fact, I had to defend our 
decision with Joel, my business partner. He'd prefer we work on some 
crazy thing he calls <i>revenue generation</i>, whatever that is. 
</p><p>
Steve McConnell has a <a href="http://blogs.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2007/11/01/technical-debt-2.aspx">lengthy blog entry examining technical debt</a>. The perils of not ackowledging your debt are clear:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
One of the important implications of technical debt is that it must be <i>serviced</i>, i.e., once you incur a debt there will be interest charges. <b>If
 the debt grows large enough, eventually the company will spend more on 
servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other 
assets.</b> A common example is a legacy code base in which so much work
 goes into keeping a production system running (i.e., "servicing the 
debt") that there is little time left over to add new capabilities to 
the system. With financial debt, analysts talk about the "debt ratio," 
which is equal to total debt divided by total assets. Higher debt ratios
 are seen as more risky, which seems true for technical debt, too. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Beyond what Steve describes here, I'd also argue that <b>accumulated technical debt becomes a major disincentive to work on a project.</b>
 It's a collection of small but annoying things that you have to deal 
with every time you sit down to write code. But it's exactly these small
 annoyances, this sand grinding away in the gears of your workday, that 
eventually causes you to stop enjoying the project. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001139.html">These small things matter</a>.
</p><p>
It can be scary to go in and <b>rebuild a lot of working code that has become crufty over time.</b> But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit#Litany_against_fear">don't succumb to fear</a>.
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
</blockquote>
<p>
When it comes time to pay down your technical debt, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000123.html">don't be afraid to break stuff</a>.
 It's liberating, even energizing to tear down code in order to build it
 up stronger and better than it was before. Be brave, and realize that 
paying your technical debt every so often is a normal, necessary part of
 the software development cycle to avert massive interest payments 
later. After all, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnTHypbLlkE#t=3m00s">who wants to live forever?</a>

  <p>I agree that sometimes it make sense to accumulate technical debt in order to meet some important deadline.<br>
However debt accumulation shouldn't last longer than couple of month. 
With time developers forget how code functions and what business logic 
that code implements. <br>
It very hard to refactor old code, so repaying technical debt later in 
time is significantly more expensive than repaying it immediately after 
deadline is met.<br>

  <p>I'd also argue that accumulated technical debt becomes a major disincentive to work on a project</p>

<p>I have to totally agree with you on this one. I'm a Computer Science 
master student, and worked with 2 fellow students on a pretty big 
project in the Netherlands. We only had our university knowledge, and at
 that moment thought we made a very good (object oriented) MVC 
implementation that would surely be flexible enough for later changes. </p>

<p>After a year, and a lot of more experience for myself and my fellow 
students, the request for changes came. I had to look through all the 
code we had written to see where the changes should be made, and I was 
truly disgusted with our own code. To finish before our deadline we 
wrote a lot of code that was not very good, but it worked and everybody 
was happy. But now I had to make some changes I could not even find out 
for myself where to start. I got so frustrated about our own work that I
 eventually turned down the job, even when it paid a lot of money (for a
 student that is).</p>

<p>As a side note I have to add, that since that project, me and my 
fellow students have had a lot more experience (real world experience 
and not university experience) and that our latest projects are much 
better than that one. So one question remains: wtf have I paid my 
college tuition for :)</p>

  <p>This is an interesting concept, Jeff.  Going back to rewrite stuff 
due to architecture is usually a bad sign (doing it because of changing 
customer needs is different, or put another way, better understanding of
 customer needs).  I find most of the time people have to go back and 
fix stuff is because of performance, and a lot of the time that's 
because they used the wrong tools in an effort to deliver functionality 
faster.<br>

 heard it explained. This post not only notes the benefits of well

quick, dirty code for small projects or one-time-run programs. You reap 
what you sow on a large project, but on a small project you usually

  <p>This is an interesting topic! I think everyone working for some 
time as a developer has had to (or ought to) pay off technical debt many
 times.</p>

<p>@Jeff, <br>
Since Stack Overflow is a relatively open site and many of your readers 
are somewhat familiar with it, this seems like a great opportunity for a
 series of articles about this in more detail</p>

<p>How did Stack Overflow handle this particular down payment. </p>

<p>What symptoms did you notice to make you want to do it, what did you 
conclude it was caused by, and how did you decide to address it?<br>
What was the design like before and after, how did you practically carry it out to avoid downtime, and what was the result?</p>

<p>What you guys have done with Stack Overflow is inspiring and 
impressive, I'm sure you have material for a whole book by now. Dreaming
 in code 2 - Stack overflow I'll pre-order! ;-)</p>

  <div class="comments-body daniel"> 
  <p>Excellent post!</p>

<p>On my last major project (18 months, 8 developers) I tried to 
convince various influential people about the importance, relevance and 
inevitability of technical debt but kept being told: refactor as you go.</p>

<p>In practice, refactoring as you go is NOT sufficient to change major 
early decisions.  And, even if it was, by constantly refactoring, you're
 never able to benefit from accruing SOME technical debt.  It is a 
perfect metaphor as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>In the end the dev team forced through major changes to the database 
and core entity model.  This broke just about everything so we had to 
spend time making the system work again instead of implementing new 
features.  Subsequent releases however almost certainly arrived quicker 
and more feature rich as a result of vastly improved productivity 
brought about by these major changes.  We discussed the situation at 
great length and nobody could see how such changes could have been 
achieved in an incremental, refactor as you go, way.  The impact on 
developer morale should not be underestimated either - the entire team 
was invigorated by this event.</p>

<p>With a large database, even small structural changes can be difficult
 to implement (think about complex data migration scripts).  But 
technical debt accrues in the database design just as much as in the 
code so can't be ignored.</p>

<p>We did not do much unit testing and while I agree they can help with 
the refactoring as you go approach, they would not have helped us during
 this major change.  Well over 80% of any unit tests would have needed 
to be substantially rewritten.  In fact, looking at the 18 month project
 as a whole, I believe having a comprehensive unit test suite would have
 _substantially_ reduced overall productivity without any significant 
(and entirely unnecessary) increase in quality.</p>

<p>I wonder if any controlled tests have been conducted to compare two 
equivalently skilled teams making identical changes to a codebase where 
one uses unit tests and the other doesn't.  It would be interesting to 
see how the productivity/quality metrics compare between these teams as 
they are asked to make different kinds of changes and where different 
amounts of technical debt pre-exist.</p>

  <div class="comments-body tim_m"> 
  <p>Very good post, I've always known about technical debt I just never knew a word for it so thnx for the word.</p>

<p>Is this technical debt caused by a rush to get features out? I think 
SO is very good which is the irony that maybe you must create this debt 
to produce something good out of the code? I would hope not but it seems
 that way sometimes.</p>

<p>Keep all debts manageable.<br>

  <div class="comments-body michael"> 
  <p>This is why I'm proposing a new methodology called Revenue Driven 
Development. What you do is you figure out the simple possible 
functionality you can charge money for, you write a test to prove out 
that functionality, you write the code to perform that function, you 
release (either internally or externally), you move on to the next 
simplest possible piece of functionality you can charge money for.</p>

<p>There are supporting practices involved... but they all work just 
like XP. The difference: under Revenue Driven Development they all have 
monikers that make marketing and financing people drool.</p>

<p>This way you figure out how to make more than the minimum monthly 
payment on your technical debt before you max out your credibility card.
 Stopping all new development on your project to do something other than
 fix actual reported bugs is like taking a second mortgage on your house
 to pay your credit card bill off. You still have the debt, perhaps on 
better terms, but if you don't learn to prevent the debt from building 
up in the first place... you're going to be in even more trouble later.</p>

Languages improve; hardware improves; operating systems improve.  
Space-Time tradeoffs change.  What may have been the provably best 
solution in 1992 is likely to be sub-optimal given current theory and 
technology.</p>

<p>For a simple case, suppose a sort algorithm were discovered that ran 
in O(n loglog n) time.  What would it take for you to rewrite everything
 to take advantage of this theoretical improvement?  Would it be worth

  <p>ah yes, but Fowler and Cunningham want you to realise the technical
 debt when it's staring you in the face, before you've made the decision
 to suck. e.g. quick but messy versus clean but longer implementation.</p>

<p>The idea is that you're not doing anyone a favor by cheating with the
 quick and messy, and the analogy is using your credit card versus 
paying cash. Use the card, you pay interest in addition to the effort, 
and the net outcome is paying more. You think you're being clever, but 
you're not. Pay with cash and you don't have to pay again. You're done.</p>

<p>There's also a peculiar notion expressed by some of you that seems to
 feel that refactoring is only to do with small code changes. 
Refactoring can be anything. It just means spending the time to make 
changes that are state-preserving. You change focus from adding features
 to cleaning code. Refactoring your architecture is still refactoring.</p>

  <p>Great post Jeff. +1 :)</p>

<p>Given the nature of some of the comments here, one could be forgiven 
for thinking that some of the commenters were forced at gunpoint to read
 and recite this post whilst their eyelids were stapled open, until it 
was burned into their psyches.</p>

<p>This experience being in stark contrast to their otherwise utopian 
existences, where stakeholders and investors do give a shit about unit 
testing and quality metrics, and never threatened to offshore a project 
because they just want it to market, like yesterday.</p>

<p>For a great many of us, getting to market fast, cheap and good enough
 is the driving factor, and what puts food on the table. We will make 
some bad decisions along the way, if the project is lucky enough to 
still be running in 12 months time, they may be fixed, and fixing them 
will quite possibly break some other shit,  there was no budget for unit
 tests, because the investors couldn't see them as a valid deliverable. 
  </p>

<p>Ideal? Hell No. Would we prefer that to be different? Hell Yeah.</p>

<p>But for a lot of developers that is the grim commercial reality of 
life, if you want unit tests, you can write em on your weekends, but on 
weekdays, investors want to see dem blinkenlights right now, and they 
want their new, pretty, and probably imperfect blinkenlights on the 
interwhatsit before their competitors. </p>

<p>It becomes even more seat of the pants when you put your own assetts 
on the line for a startup, as I dare say Jeff did to some extent. In 
that case, willing to take technical debt in return for cashflow, 
pagerank and less time to market anyday. </p>

<p>If it floats, you may have a chance to fix it, if it sinks, move 
along. Unless you make an absolute dog of a product, market factors and 
bling on your UI will be much more a determinant of your initial success
 than software quality. If it does make money, and no one really notices
 the imperfections, they may never get fixed, because it's probably not a
 weapon aiming system.  </p>

<p>For those who don't exist in this sometimes dystopian place for 
lesser mortals, that seemingly offends you so, why are you here? </p>

  <p>I think it's excellent that you're recognizing the technical debt

<p>Also, unit tests are a big help with managing technical debt. Fear is

<p>As other commenters have suggested on this post and others, Joel and 
your position on automatic tests seems a little extreme though.  Sure, 
tests do have a cost.  But as a code base matures, interfaces (in the 
loose sense) to larger units should tend to stabilise.  (Unless there is
 no architecture at all - ie. big ball of mud.)  So the ongoing cost of 
testing at least some of the code should go down, and change the 
cost-benefit equation.  Even if you don't buy into the 100%

  <p>It seems to me that most of the people criticizing the metaphor or 
Jeff are only looking at the idea from a very narrow perspective.</p>

<p>To pick on just one, the idea that most refactoring would be a waste 
of time based on 10% being the average amount of technical debt on a 
project seems ridiculous to me.  Even if 10% were the average, it is 
representative of such a small slice of the projects going on out there 
that it proves nothing about whether or not refactoring in general is 
worth while.</p>

<p>In the real world on projects of all sizes, technical debt can be 
accrued for so many reasons outside of developer control, from customer 
pressure for design changes to hardware and environment changes that the
 technical debt can fluctuate dramatically within a single day.  
Furthermore, it's impossible to predict *all* of these changes and 
account for them in the architecture from day one or you would be 
wasting an incredible amount of time not having a working 
site/application that is bringing in no money.  </p>

<p>The biggest take away from the article should not be whether you 
think you are smart enough or more likely lucky enough that you haven't 
run into the issue on your projects, but to be aware that it does happen
 on a large number of real world projects.  I'm not saying that getting 
into too much technical debt is an everyday occurrence or that it always
 happens fast or that it is never the developers' fault.  Whatever the 
reason, speed of accrual or where the blame lies, it does happen, you 
should be aware that it happens, and you should be critical enough to 
recognize when paying down the debt makes sense.</p>

  <p>Re - changing number of arguments to a function...</p>

<p>(1) The eclipse refactoring for Java change method signature will 
rewrite all the callers to the function for you, supplying a default 
value, so that's not a lot a work.</p>

<p> (2) if you have more than (approximately) 10 tests/test-setups 
calling a particular method, you have too much duplication in your tests
 and/or the function being tested is too large. </p>

<p>Use mock objects, stubs, fakes, etc., to decouple classes so that a 
single test only tests one interesting bit of behavior of one method of 
one class, not testing the whole pyramid of behaviors invoked by a 
high-level method. You still want _some_ integration and acceptance 
tests, but not everything has to be tested that way.</p>

<p>With test-driven development, refactoring, and paying attention to 
code smells [like Large Class, Large Method, Duplicate Logic] and test 
smells [like Expensive Setup, Duplicate Logic, Large Test], you don't 
have the problem of one change making lots of tests fail.  </p>

<p>any idea how to explain to the company that what they expect costs 
much more than they know ? And how to explain we need them to still fund

<p>or even worst, telling the truth:<br>
We have no idea how much it will cost utlimatly, but for the fragmented 
data we have the purposal you have in hand is the most appealing that we
 can write.<br>
Of course we can intend to collect enough data to have a more precise 
idea of the real cost without technical debt, but that study alone will 
likely cost more than the whole project that you have in mind....</p>

  <p>I'd also argue that accumulated technical debt becomes a major disincentive to work on a project</p>

<p>This is more important than it is usually given credit for. Good 
programmers dislike dirty code. They want to get rid of it, they don't 
want to be around it and they certainly don't want to be associated with
 it.</p>

<p>The point is that a technical debt is not just an undocumented hole 
in the budget, it's an undocumented HR problem. It lowers moral and 
raises staff turnover.</p>

<p>If your project has a high level of technical debt it makes everyone 
who works on it look inexplicably inefficient and weak. People 
procrastinate rather than touch such painful code, they try to avoid the
 project, their more tempted to make quick and dirty fixes just to get 
away from it faster and in the worst case they'll leave the company to 
leave the mess behind. Likewise attracting and retaining quality new 
staff is going to be hampered by having a high technical debt.</p>

<p>The point is to look at technical debt as both a financial burden and
 an HR burden. Programmers working in a clean, powerful, elegant 
development environment are more motivated, more interested in producing
 more code of a similar standard and less interested in leaving the 
company.</p>

Enabling software development to be taken seriously by business is

<p>Living in the dark and hoping to achieve validation by not examining

  <p>Great post. I work for a Fortune 100 company. We face technical 
debt in two ways. The first, we have a large legacy base (all that COBOL
 stuff the business really runs on). Over 30 years additions, changes, 
and hardcoding have been added to solve problems but rarely has anyone 
refactored. A lot of this is because its hard to refactor COBOL into 
anything but long complex COBOL programs with confusing global 
variables. Today we have less than 5 or 6 people who would even be 
qualified to touch the code, everyone else is scared. We've ignored it 
so long the people best qualified to understand it have retired (or

ultimately facing bankruptcy on the code and start over with a new 
system.</p>

<p>The second is on new projects that are run by non-technical MS 
Project leaders. They want to stick to the project plan and meet their 
timeline. This is admirable and I agree they are necessary to make sure 
we actually deliver on time. But combine this with a large outsourced 
Indian development work for the focus is on make it work now and ignore 
the future. Once a feature is written which does basically what it 
should do and with reasonable performance its marked done and not 
touched again. </p>

<p>I deal with both legacy and new code. My mantra is don't be afraid to
 rewrite code. Its scary to do so, but the benefits are huge. Even if 
you don't do it any better, you at least didn't blindly leave it as a 
mess and will have a better understanding. I always try to have at least
 one developer on the team that does code maintenance, they understand 
the pain later by not being willing to rewrite code.</p>

<p> What exactly do you mean by refactoring?  That is a buzzword I see 
on a lot of PP charts.  If you mean rewriting code to embrace new 
architectures, etc. (multi-core, openmp, etc), please say so.  If you 
mean re-designing projects so they will score less on the stinkometer, 
please say that too.</p>

  <p>Like the real-estate meltdown I forsee a software meltdown.<br>
There will come a time when this stuff becomes so complex that no single
 or probably dozen human minds will be able to comprehend it.</p>

<p>That will probably be the time when the machines decide to refactor us...</p>

<p>What does this have to do with technical debt? There is a hidden and 
very real cost in complexity. I'm not at all sure that I am happier 
today than when I was a boy.</p>

<p>Sure, we did not have video games, computers, and all the gadgets and
 gizmos of today. However; I do believe that I was happier then, the 
world was less complex and less daunting.</p>

<p>I see kids today going from zombies training for a future war in 
front of an XBox to totally overloaded in certain school situations to 
sometimes outright disaster with things like facebook.</p>

<p>I've worked in this industry for the past 30 years and most of the time it's been relatively kind to me.</p>

<p>So, what can I do without?<br>
Cell phones: don't need it, don't want it.<br>
GPS: I can get around just fine thank you very much.<br>
DTV: People watch too much TV anyway. I might just go dark on June 12th.<br>
Home Computer: This probably only applies to me; I work with one all day long, why do I want to see it in my house?<br>
Internet: This is blasphemy I know but; I got by just fine before it 
became all the rage, I make money on it now... Has it really changed my 
life for the better? Yes because I work on it but, if I was not in this 
industry would I really need it? Probably not.<br>
What do I not want to do without:<br>
Medical Machinery breakthroughs such as MRI and CT scans, dialysis 
machines, pace makers, heart monitors, etc. Life saving applications are
 among the greatest applications for technology.<br>
Electronic Ignition: The best thing that ever happend to the internal combustion engine.<br>
Automated alarm systems: Unfortunately, we still have crooks in the world.<br>
And the ONE THING I HATE THE MOST:<br>
ELECTRONIC VOTING: If we thought things got screwed up with the paper

<p>What do you get from this display of small mindedness? Is it 
jealousy?  Does Jeff order you around? Plot things in your life? Try to 
get you fired? Or try to steal your customers and contracts? </p>

<p>Anyone stopping you from starting a blog of your own?<br>
If you're traced anywhere on the blogosphere in the future, you are 
going to be remembered by lots of people. People remember others even if
 they genuinely protest, having a decent case to present. </p>

<p>And you here, are trying this! Whatever makes you think that this 
will go unnoticed or be forgotten? Do you have any idea of how many 
multiple copies of this content exist on the expanded web (public web + 
private docs on net-connected PCs) ?</p>

<p>One announcement by Joel and Jeff to ask readers to volunteer to 
point out routine trolls by identifying their posting pattern will 
finish the whole race of trolls. That they don't exercise that option is
 a quality of theirs, not a fear of you. </p>

<p>In the case of less scrupled community leaders, even a genuine 
protest brings a much harder response. And you think that Jeff cannot 
ask users to finish the entire race of you trolls? </p>

<p>Deleting your posts is NOT the painful thing. Keeping them marked as 
Sick F**king Troll for permanent public display is much worse. If you've
 posted under influence, I'm sorry, as much as you would be. But if not,
 then I think you might need to change your online nickname.<br>
Trolling is counterproductive and cruel. Give it a peaceful thought.</p>

  <p>Alex,</p>

<p>@Great post. I work for a Fortune 100 company. We face technical debt
 in two ways. The first, we have a large legacy base (all that COBOL 
stuff the business really runs on). Over 30 years additions, changes, 
and hardcoding have been added to solve problems but rarely has anyone 
refactored. A lot of this is because its hard to refactor COBOL into 
anything but long complex COBOL programs with confusing global 
variables.</p>

<p>Sorry but this isn't true.  COBOL refactoring tools do exist.  Netron
 Fusion is an example.  It won't solve all your problems and may not 
even realistically be worth it for you, but there is a book that talks 
about properly factored COBOL code (if such a thing exists!): Framing 
Software Reuse by Paul G. Bassett.</p>

  <p>Let me start by saying I know nothing about your project. However, let's take the technical debt analogy and run with it.</p>

<p>How much are the interest repayments on that technical debt? 25%, 15%%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%?</p>

<p>However, for most projects I think that 10% is typical for most 
projects. Let's say you do two weeks (10 working days) of refactoring to
 get the technical debt interest rate down to 1%.</p>

<p>Before the refactoring you were working at 90% effectiveness and 
after the refactoring you're operating 99% effectiveness. A 
straightforward calculation shows that it would take 124 working days 
(or 29 weeks) to be ahead where you would have been if you hadn't have 
refactored at all.</p>

<p>This is why your business partner wasn't convinced. If you'd spent 
that two weeks adding or improving pre-existing features, it's obviously
 going to add a lot more value to the project than the time spent 
refactoring.</p>

<p>I find that the technical debt analogy actually proves the opposite 
of what the proponents of term what to demonstrate: that refactoring is 
typically a really bad use of project time!</p>

  <p> Unit testing, in this context, is irrelevant; you WILL make imperfect architectural decisions early on.</p>

<p>Very true Jeff. Having unit tests does nothing to eliminate technical
 debt. In fact unit tests themselves, being more code, can have their 
own technical debt too.</p>

<p> Now you could argue that having a lot of unit tests makes it easier to make sweeping architectural changes.</p>

<p>Yes!!!! And this is the key argument for writing tests. It's not just a side benefit of having them.</p>

<p>For any kind of refactoring - including eliminating technical debt - 
 having unit tests, and as importantly, having functional or full stack 
tests can be a _huge_ help. More than enough to make it worth having 
taken the time to write the tests in the first place.</p>

  <p>I also like the metaphor.  Has anyone tried to measure technical

approach? I realize that it's difficult to measure in any accurate way;

  <p>There is a big difference between refactoring your own code and 
refactoring someone else's code. It is too easy to try to rewrite 
"legacy" code only because a newcomer doesn't understand it. Our own 
abstractions are more familiar to us than someone else's.</p>

  <div class="comments-body daniel_e_graham"> 
  <p>For a major refactoring effort, such as completely rewriting 
something in another language - it would appear that it could result in 
adding technical debt during the refactoring. That's something to 
consider. Also, the refactoring shouldn't result in less features. But, 
if a new team can clearly identify bad design decisions or lower level 
code issues, then incremental refactoring is good. But, to just assume 
that the new people are "smarter" than the old people and just rewrite 
everything, is not as good.</p>
